# firebase-auth
Login and Authentication practice using Firebase and OAuth, Google Accounts.

## notes
Firebase is a *serverless* cloud computing service and a database of sorts, where a traditional back-end is not necessary.
This is a simple login code that also allows the user the option to log in using a Google Account.

## roadmap
- [ ] Fix console.log error messages
- [ ] Fix popup error when closing the window (auth/popup-closed-by-user should not be considered an error)
